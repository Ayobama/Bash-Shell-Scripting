   SpatialKey unlocks the full potential of time- and location-based
   information like nothing else out there. In minutes, you can upload a
   data file and create and share interactive time- and map-based analyses
   and reports. Even if you're new to SpatialKey, it's easy to start
   exploring the power of location intelligence. Upload your own data or
   grab a sample file below to get started. Easy steps:
    1. Click on one of the sample files below. It will be saved to your
       desktop.
    2. Log in to your SpatialKey account and follow the simple onscreen
       instructions to upload the sample file from your desktop.

Sample data files

Sample insurance portfolio ([14]download .csv file)

   The sample insurance file contains 36,634 records in Florida for 2012
   from a sample company that implemented an agressive growth plan in
   2012.  There are total insured value (TIV) columns containing TIV from
   2011 and 2012, so this dataset is great for testing out the comparison
   feature.  This file has address information that you can choose to
   geocode, or you can use the existing latitude/longitude in the file.

Real estate transactions ([15]download .csv file)

   The Sacramento real estate transactions file is a list of 985 real
   estate transactions in the Sacramento area reported over a five-day
   period, as reported by the [16]Sacramento Bee. Note that this file has
   address level information that you can choose to geocode, or you can
   use the existing latitude/longitude in the file.

Sales transactions ([17]download .csv file)

   The Sales Jan 2009 file contains some "sanitized" sales transactions
   during the month of January. Below is a sample of a report built in
   just a couple of minutes using the Blank Canvas app. These 998
   transactions are easily summarized and filtered by transaction date,
   payment type, country, city, and geography. Note that these records are
   already geocoded, so you can use the existing latitude/longitude in the
   file.

Company Funding Records ([18]download .csv file)

   The TechCrunch Continental USA file is a listing of 1,460 company
   funding records reported by [19]TechCrunch. As part of the import
   process, geocode these records using the city and state information in
   the file.  Try adding another map layer with the Dataset Configuration
   Panel so you can visualize both a heatmap and graduated circles with
   the same dataset.

Crime Records ([20]download .csv file)

   The Sacramento crime January 2006 file contains 7,584 crime records, as
   made available by the Sacramento Police Department. Law enforcement
   agencies should enjoy working with this dataset.
