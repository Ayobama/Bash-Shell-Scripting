**My Shell Ideal**

When you start writing your first scripts, it is important to get into a good habit of clearly labelling each section of the script with comments and any details that are relevant. 

A. Always use comments
B. Add the authors name to the script
C. Include a version number of a script. 
D. Add a brief description as to the main function of the script. 



_Sample template here;_
!/bin/bash

 Script Name: mytest.sh

 Author: Name of creator
 Date : Date of creation

 Description: The following script reads in a text file called /path/to/file and creates a new file called /path/to/newfile

 Run Information: This script is run automatically every Monday of every week at 20:00hrs from a crontab entry. 

 Error Log: Any errors or output associated with the script can be found in /path/to/logfile



Always try to make the script easy to read so that others can easily understand the functionality of the script. 

Below are a few hints and tips that you should try to adopt within your scripts.
