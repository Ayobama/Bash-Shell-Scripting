                                  CSV Files
     __________________________________________________________________

   CSV is a data directory which contains examples of CSV files, a flat
   file format describing values in a table.

   Each record consists of M values, separated by commas. However, the
   last value is not followed by a comma.

   Double quotes are used as escape characters. A string with a comma can
   be delimited by double quotes so that that comma is not misinterpreted
   as a field separator.

   To de-escape a double quote, that is, to use it literally, use two
   double quotes.

   A final, unmatched, double quote on a line indicates that that line is
   to be continued on the next line.

   In some cases, a CSV file includes an initial line of headers.
