LMAO Meaning

   LMAO stands for "laughing my ass off", but did you know there are other
   acronyms for laughter? There are also acronyms used in text messaging
   that stand for a lot of other things. Acronyms like LMAO allow people
   to text faster while conveying the same meaning.
   What follows is what many of these acronyms stand for.
   lmao-meaning
   (BUTTON)

   LMAO is one of many common words used in text messaging, instant
   messaging, chatting, and on Facebook and Twitter. At one time or
   another, you've probably seen this Internet slang. Do you wonder what
   LMAO means? Did you know it could have more than one meaning?
   LMAO is an acronym that stands for Laughing My Ass Off. Many people say
   (or text) this acronym when they find something particularly funny.
   Sometimes, when a person finds something extremely funny, they say
   LMFAO. This is almost identical in meaning but has the "F" word added
   to it to create Laughing My F**king A** Off. This one, however, is
   considered to be vulgar and is probably NSFW (not safe for work.)
   Another acronym used with LMAO is ROFL. People often say "ROFLMAO"
   which is used to signify something that is even more hilarious! ROFL
   means "rolling on the floor laughing."

Do you know what LIGMA means?

Acronyms to Express Laughter Online

   CAPTION:

   1. LOL (laughing out loud)

   2. LOLZ (more than one laugh)

   3. ROFL (rolling on the floor laughing)

   4. LQTM (laughing quietly to myself)

   5. LSMH (laughing & shaking my head)

   6. LMHO (laughing my head off)

   7. HAHA (this one goes without saying)

   8. :D (laughing emoji)
   Hee hee hee!

Alternative Meanings: What Else Could LMAO Stand for?

   LMAO has a number of different meanings, but it is most often used to
   tell a person that something is funny. Because of this, many people are
   unaware of or do not use alternative meanings.

What LMAO Means

   If you use LMAO to mean any of the following, make sure that your
   audience is aware of your alternative meaning to avoid confusion (and
   the possibility of offense.) While some of them can be hilariously
   funny, you have to make sure that your friends know what they mean.
     * Laughing my arms (or ankles) off.
     * Lick me all over!
     * Leave me alone, okay?
     * Let's meet (or last man) at the office.
     * Let's make an oath/offer.

   In addition, there is a phrase, ayy lmao, popular on Tumblr. It is
   commonly used in reference to aliens. Ayy lmao is a phrase supposedly
   uttered by extra-terrestrials. There is no known human meaning behind
   the word, only aliens know its true meaning. What does it mean to you?

Netspeak vs. Leetspeak

   Words such as LOL (meaning laugh out loud), LMAO, and LMFAO make up
   what is called netspeak, also sometimes called chatspeak. A large
   number of people on sites like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter use these
   acronyms and abbreviations. However, many were used before these
   websites even existed.

   Netspeak is also related to leetspeak, a language developed by hackers
   which allowed them to slip past email filters. Leetspeak works by
   substituting letters with numbers or different letters that are similar
   in appearance. For example, the letter E would be replaced with the
   number 3. Spelling may also be slightly altered in some words. In fact,
   the term leet in the very name of the language is often written as
   1337.
   Leetspeak became popular and is no longer used solely by hackers. While
   it did gain popularity, it still isn't a huge part of social networking
   sites like Facebook. It is mostly used by online gamers, programmers
   (most hackers are programmers), and forum posters.

Examples of Leetspeak

     * ski11z = skills
     * 1337 = leet
     * haxxor = hacker
     * n00b = noob, newbie (This means a newcomer and is usually meant as
       an insult.)

   This content is accurate and true to the best of the author's knowledge
   and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice
   from a qualified professional.

   Paul Beenis The term "leet" is derived from the word elite, used as an
   adjective to describe formidable prowess or accomplishment, especially
   in the fields of online gaming and computer hacking. The leet lexicon
   includes spellings of the word as 1337 or l33t.

   Leet stands for leet words, originally a hacker language but now more

   through online filters etc. Leet is, itself turned into a leet word by
   changing the letters into the numbers 1337. 8u88l37_ is another
   example.
