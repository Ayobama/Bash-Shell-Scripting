# Bash-Shell-Scripting
all my bash sh logs

This is where I put in and track my progress using Bash. Eventually I can better use Zsh and Kali


My Ideal

A. Always use comments
B. Add the authors name to the script
C. Include a version number of a script. 
D. Add a brief description as to the main function of the script. 
 
Sample template
#!/bin/bash
#
# Script Name: mytest.sh
#
# Author: Name of creator
# Date : Date of creation
#
# Description: The following script reads in a text file called /path/to/file 
#              and creates a new file called /path/to/newfile
#
# Run Information: This script is run automatically every Monday of every week at 20:00hrs from
#                  a crontab entry.

# Error Log:
